<h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>

<p>In this hands-on lab, you will learn how to deploy your first application in Windows Azure. The lab walks through the process using myTODO, a simple list creation and management application built using ASP.NET MVC. The lab shows the steps required for provisioning the required components in the Windows Azure Management Portal, uploading the service package, and configuring the service. You will see how you can test your application in a staging environment and then promote it to production once you are satisfied that it is operating according to your expectations.</p>

<h3 id="Exercise_1_Deploying_an_application_using_the_Windows_Azure_Management_Portal">Exercise 1: Deploying an application using the Windows Azure Management Portal</h3>

<p>In this exercise, you deploy the myTODO application to Windows Azure using the Windows Azure Management Portal. To do this, you provision the required service components at the management portal, upload the application package to the staging environment and configure it. You then execute the application in this test environment to verify its operation. Once you are satisfied that it operates according to your expectations, you promote the application to production.</p>

<p><a name="Ex1Task1"></a></p>

<h4 id="Task_1_-_Creating_a_Storage_Account_and_a_Cloud_Service">Task 1 - Creating a Storage Account and a Cloud Service</h4>

<p>The application you deploy in this exercise requires a Cloud Service and a Storage Account. In this task, you create a new storage account to allow the application to persist its data. In addition, you define a Cloud Service to host your web application.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Navigate to <a href="http://manage.windowsazure.com"><a href="http://manage.windowsazure.com/">http://manage.windowsazure.com/</a></a> using a Web browser and sign in using the Microsoft Account associated with your Windows Azure account.</p>

<li><p>Click <strong>Create</strong> in order to create a new <strong>Affinity Group</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="images/create-affinity-group.png?raw=true" alt="Create Affinity Group" title="Create Affinity Group" />
</p>

<p><em>Create Affinity Group</em></p></li>
<li><p>In the <strong>Create Affinity Group</strong> dialog, enter a <strong>Name</strong> (i.e. <em>MyAffinityGroup</em>), a <strong>Description</strong> and the <strong>Region</strong> for your new group. Then click the <strong>Tick</strong> to continue.</p>

<p><img src="images/affinity-group-details.png?raw=true" alt="Affinity Group Details" title="Affinity Group Details" />
</p>

<p><em>Affinity Group Details</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The reason that you are creating a new affinity group is to deploy both the cloud service and storage account to the same location, thus ensuring high bandwidth and low latency between the application and the data it depends on.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Now, you will create the <strong>Storage Account</strong> that the application will use to store its data. In the Windows Azure Management Portal, click <strong>New</strong> | <strong>Storage Account</strong> | <strong>Quick Create</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Set a unique <strong>URL</strong>, for example <em>yournamemytodo</em>, select the <em>Affinity Group</em> you previously created and click the <strong>Tick</strong> to continue.</p>

<p><img src="images/creating-a-new-storage-account.png?raw=true" alt="Creating a new storage account" />
</p>

<p><em>Creating a new storage account</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The URL used for the storage account corresponds to a DNS name and is subject to standard DNS naming rules. Moreover, the name is publicly visible and must therefore be unique. The portal ensures that the name is valid by verifying that the name complies with the naming rules and is currently available. A validation error will be shown if you enter a name that does not satisfy the rules.</p>

<p><img src="images/url-validation.png?raw=true" alt="URL Validation" />
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Wait until the Storage Account is created. Click your storage account's name to go to its <strong>Dashboard</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="images/storage-accounts-page.png?raw=true" alt="Storage Accounts page" title="Storage Accounts page" />
</p>

<p><em>Storage Accounts page</em></p></li>
<li><p>In the <strong>Dashboard</strong> page, you will see the <strong>URL</strong> assigned to each service in the storage account. Record the public storage account name, this is the first segment of the URL assigned to your endpoints.</p>

<p><img src="images/storage-account-dashboard-page.png?raw=true" alt="Storage Account Dashboard page" title="Storage Account Dashboard page" />
</p>

<p><em>Storage Account Dashboard page</em></p></li>
<li><p>Click <strong>Manage Keys</strong> at the bottom of the page in order to show the storage account's access keys.</p>

<p><img src="images/manage-storage-account-keys.png?raw=true" alt="Manage Storage Account Keys" title="Manage Storage Account Keys" />
</p>

<p><em>Manage Storage Account Keys</em></p></li>
<li><p>Copy the <strong>Primary access key</strong> value. You will use this value later on to configure the application.</p>

<p><img src="images/retrieving-the-storage-access-keys.png?raw=true" alt="Retrieving the storage access keys" />
</p>

<p><em>Retrieving the storage access keys</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The <strong>Primary Access Key</strong> and <strong>Secondary</strong> Access <strong>Key</strong> both provide a shared secret that you can use to access storage. The secondary key gives the same access as the primary key and is used for backup purposes. You can regenerate each key independently in case either one is compromised.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Next, create the <strong>Cloud Service</strong> that executes the application code. Click <strong>New</strong> | <strong>Cloud Service</strong> | <strong>Quick Create</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Select a <strong>URL</strong> for your Cloud Service (e.g. <em>yournamemytodo</em>) and choose the <strong>Affinity Group</strong> where you created the Storage Account. Click the <strong>Tick</strong> to continue. Windows Azure uses the URL value to generate the endpoint URLs for the cloud service.</p>

</p>

<p><em>Creating a new Cloud Service</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If possible, choose the same name for both the storage account and cloud service. However, you may need to choose a different name if the one you select is unavailable.</p>

<p>The portal ensures that the name is valid by verifying that the name complies with the naming rules and is currently available. A validation error will be shown if you enter name that does not satisfy the rules.</p>

<p><img src="images/url-prefix-validation.png?raw=true" alt="URL prefix validation" />
</p>

<p>By choosing the same affinity group you used for your storage account, you ensure that the Cloud Service is deployed to the same data center.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Wait until your Cloud Service is created to continue. Do not close the browser window, you will use the portal for the next task.</p>

<h4 id="Task_2_-_Publishing_the_Application_to_the_Windows_Azure_Management_Portal">Task 2 - Publishing the Application to the Windows Azure Management Portal</h4>

<p>A Cloud Service is a service that hosts your code in the Windows Azure environment. It has two separate deployment slots: staging and production. The staging deployment slot allows you to test your service in the Windows Azure environment before you deploy it to production. </p>

<p>In this task, you create a service package for the myTODO application and then deploy it to the staging environment using the Windows Azure Management Portal.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Open <strong>Microsoft Visual Studio 2010</strong> with elevated administrator mode.</p></li>
<li><p>In the <strong>File</strong> menu, choose <strong>Open</strong> and then <strong>Project/Solution</strong>. In the <strong>Open Project</strong> dialog, browse to <strong>Ex1-DeployingWithWAZPortal\Begin</strong> in the <strong>Source</strong> folder of the lab, select <strong>MyTodo.sln</strong> and click Open.</p>

<p>The solution contains the following projects:</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td>MyTodo</td>
<td>A standard cloud service project configured to support a single web role named <strong>MyTodo.WebUx</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>MyTodo.Data.WindowsAzure</td>
<td>A class library project that contains data contracts for the <strong>MyTodo.WebUx</strong> application for table storage</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>AspProviders</td>
<td>An implementation of ASP.NET Membership, Role, and SessionState providers for Storage in Windows Azure</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>MyTodo.WebUx</td>
<td>A web role that hosts the MyTODO ASP.NET MVC application in Windows Azure</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table></li>
<li><p>Ensure that the <strong>System.Web.Mvc</strong> assembly is included in the service package that you deploy to Windows Azure.  To do this, expand the <strong>References</strong> node in <strong>Solution Explorer</strong> for the <strong>MyTodo.WebUx</strong> project, right-click the <strong>System.Web.Mvc</strong> assembly and select <strong>Properties</strong>. In the <strong>Project Properties</strong> window, switch to the <strong>References</strong> tab, select the <strong>System.Web.Mvc</strong> assembly, and press <strong>F4</strong>. </p>

<p>To add the assembly to the service package, in the <strong>Properties</strong> window for the <strong>System.Web.Mvc</strong> assembly, if <strong>Copy Local</strong> setting is set to <em>False</em> then change it to <em>True</em>.</p>

<p><img src="images/including-assemblies-in-the-service-package-d.png?raw=true" alt="Including assemblies in the service package deployed to Windows Azure" title="Including assemblies in the service package deployed to Windows Azure" />
</p>

<p><em>Including assemblies in the service package deployed to Windows Azure</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In general, you need to set <strong>Copy Local = True</strong> for any assembly that is not installed by default in the Windows Azure VMs to ensure that it is deployed with your application. </p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Next, change the size of the virtual machine that will host the application. To do this, in <strong>Solution Explorer</strong>, expand the <strong>Roles</strong> node of the <strong>MyTodo</strong> project and then double-click the <strong>MyTodo.WebUX</strong> role to open its properties window. In the <strong>Configuration</strong> page, locate the <strong>VM</strong> Size setting under the <strong>Instances</strong> category and choose the <strong>Extra small</strong> size from the drop down list.</p>

<p><img src="images/configuring-vm-depl-size.png?raw=true" alt="Configuring the size of the virtual machine for the deployment" title="Configuring the size of the virtual machine for the deployment" />
</p>

<p><em>Configuring the size of the virtual machine (VM) for the deployment</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When you create your service model, you can specify the size of the virtual machine (VM) to which to deploy instances of your role, depending on its resource requirements. The size of the VM determines the number of CPU cores, the memory capacity, the local file system size allocated to a running instance, and the network throughput.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>To configure the storage before deploying the service, open <strong>ServiceConfiguration.cscfg</strong> file located in <strong>MyTodo</strong> service. Replace the placeholder labeled [YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME] with the <strong>Storage Account Name</strong> that you chose when you configured the storage account in Task 1. If you followed the recommendation, the name should follow the pattern <strong>&lt;yourname&gt;mytodo</strong>, where  &lt; <em>yourname</em>&gt;  is a unique name. Make sure to replace both instances of the placeholder, one for the <em>DataConnectionString</em> and the second one for the <em>Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Plugins.Diagnostics.ConnectionString</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Next, replace the placeholder labeled [YOUR_ACCOUNT_KEY] with the <strong>Primary Access Key</strong> value that you recorded earlier, when you created the storage account in Task 1. Again, replace both instances of the placeholder, one for each connection string.</p>

<p><img src="images/configuring-storage-account-connection.png?raw=true" alt="Configuring the storage account connection strings" title="Configuring the storage account connection strings" />
</p>

<p><em>Configuring the storage account connection strings</em></p></li>
<li><p>Now, define the version of the Windows Azure Guest Operating System that should run your service on the virtual machine. To do this, double-click the <strong>ServiceConfiguration.cscfg</strong> file in the <strong>MyTodo</strong> project to open this file in the XML editor. Now, add an <strong>osVersion</strong> attribute to the <strong>ServiceConfiguration</strong> root element and set its value to <em>WA-GUEST-OS-1.8_201010-01</em>, as shown in the figure below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The value used for <strong>osVersion</strong> here is to illustrate that you can select which release of the guest OS runs your application. You may use a higher version. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="images/configuring-guestOS.png?raw=true" alt="Configuring which version of the guest operating system runs the application in the VM" title="Configuring which version of the guest operating system runs the application in the VM" />
</p>

<p><em>Configuring which version of the guest operating system runs the application in the VM</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Windows Azure runs a guest operating system into which your service application will be deployed. This guest operating system is regularly updated. While rare, there is some chance that updated guest operating system versions may introduce breaking changes in your application. By setting the <strong>osVersion</strong> attribute, you ensure that your application runs in a version of the Windows Azure guest operating system that is compatible with the version of the Windows Azure SDK with which you developed it. You may then take the time to test each new <strong>osVersion</strong> prior to running it in your production deployment.</p>

<p>To configure the operating system version, you need to edit the service definition file directly because the current release of the Windows Azure Tools for Microsoft Visual Studio does not support setting this attribute through its user interface. </p>

<p>Windows Azure offers an auto-upgrade feature, that automatically upgrades your service to use the latest OS version whenever it becomes available, thus ensuring that your service runs in an environment with the latest security fixes. This is the default mode if you omit an <strong>osVersion</strong> when you deploy your service. To change an existing service to auto-upgrade mode, set the <strong>osVersion</strong> attribute to the value &quot;*&quot;.</p>

<p>For information on available versions of the Windows Azure guest operating system, see <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee924680(v=MSDN.10).aspx">Windows Azure Guest OS Versions and SDK Compatibility Matrix</a>.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Press <strong>CTRL + S</strong> to save the changes to the service model.</p></li>
<li><p>To create a service package, right-click the cloud service project and select <strong>Package</strong>. </p></li>
<li><p>In the <strong>Package Windows Azure Application</strong> dialog, click <strong>Package</strong> and then wait until Visual Studio creates it. Once the package is ready, Visual Studio opens a window showing the folder that contains the generated files. Do not close this window, you will use the packages later in this task.</p>

<p><img src="images/creating-a-service-package.png?raw=true" alt="Creating a service package in Visual Studio" title="Creating a service package in Visual Studio" />

<p><em>Creating a service package in Visual Studio</em></p></li>
<li><p>At the portal, locate the Cloud Service you previously created and click its name in order to go to the <strong>Dashboard</strong> page.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure <strong>Staging</strong> tab is selected and then click <strong>Upload new staging deployment</strong>.</p>

<p><em>Uploading the Application to Windows Azure</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> A Cloud Service is a service that runs your code in the Windows Azure environment. It has two separate deployment slots: staging and production. The staging deployment slot allows you to test your service in the Windows Azure environment before you deploy it to production.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>In the <strong>Cloud Service - Upload Package</strong> dialog click <strong>Browse</strong> to select a <strong>Package location</strong> and navigate to the folder where Visual Studio generated the package in the prior steps and then select <strong>MyTodo.cspkg</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The <em>.cspkg</em> file is an archive file that contains the binaries and files required to run a service - in this case it's the Notification App Server ASP.NET MVC application. We used Visual Studio to create the service package for you using <strong>Build | Publish</strong> for the Windows Azure project.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Now, to choose the <strong>Configuration File</strong>, click <strong>Browse</strong> and select <strong>ServiceConfiguration.cscfg</strong> file within the same folder.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The <em>.cscfg</em> file contains configuration settings for the application, including the instance count and configuration for <strong>WNS</strong> and the Storage account that you performed in the previous exercise.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>For the <strong>Deployment Name</strong>, enter a label to identify the deployment; for example, use <em>MyTodo-v1</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The management portal displays the label in its user interface for staging and production, which allows you to identify the version currently deployed in each environment.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Finally, check <strong>Deploy even if one or more roles contain a single instace</strong>. Then click the <strong>Tick</strong> to start the deployment.</p>

Notice that the portal assigned a <strong>DNS name</strong> to the deployment that includes a unique identifier. Shortly, you will access this URL to test the application and determine whether it operates correctly in the Windows Azure environment, but first you need to configure it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> During deployment, Windows Azure analyzes the configuration file and copies the service to the correct number of machines, and starts all the instances. Load balancers, network devices and monitoring are also configured during this time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The address URL is shown as <em>&lt;guid&gt;.azurewebsites.net</em>, where &lt;<em>guid</em>&gt; is some random identifier. This is different from the address where the application will run once it is in production. Although the application executes in a staging area that is separate from the production environment, there is no actual physical difference between staging and production - it is simply a matter of where the load balancer is connected.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> In the future, you will be able to have multiple &quot;virtual&quot; areas, for test, QA, pre-production, etc... </p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Click <strong>Start</strong> to prepare the application for first time use, which requires you to create a new account. To do this, navigate to register menu.</p>

Keep in mind that Windows Azure creates DNS name entries dynamically and that the changes might take few minutes to propagate.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Even when a deployment is in a suspended state, Windows Azure still needs to allocate a virtual machine (VM) for each instance and charge you for it. Once you have completed testing the application, you need to remove the deployment from Windows Azure to avoid an unnecessary expense. To remove a running deployment, go to your Cloud Service <strong>Dashboard</strong> page, select the deployment slot where the service is currently hosted, staging or production, and then click <strong>Stop</strong> on the bottom menu. Once the service has stopped, click <strong>Delete</strong> to remove it.</p>

<h3 id="Exercise_2_Using_PowerShell_to_manage_Windows_Azure_Applications">Exercise 2: Using PowerShell to manage Windows Azure Applications</h3>

<p>Typically, during its lifetime, an application undergoes changes that require it to be re-deployed. In the previous exercise, you saw how to use the Windows Azure Management Portal to deploy applications. As an alternative, the Service Management API provides programmatic access to much of the functionality available through the Management Portal. Using the Service Management API, you can manage your storage accounts and cloud services, your service deployments, and your affinity groups.</p>

<p>The Windows Azure Service Management PowerShell Cmdlets wrap the Windows Azure Service Management API. These cmdlets make it simple to automate the deployment, upgrade, and scaling of your Windows Azure application. By pipelining commands, you compose complex scripts that use the output of one command as the input to another.</p>

<p>In this exercise, you will learn how to deploy and upgrade a Windows Azure application using the Azure Services Management Cmdlets. </p>

<h4 id="Task_1_-_Downloading_and_Importing_a_Publish-settings_File">Task 1 - Downloading and Importing a Publish-settings File</h4>

<p>In this task, you will log on to the Windows Azure Portal and download the publish-settings file. This file contains the secure credentials and additional information about your Windows Azure Subscription to use in your development environment. Then, you will import this file using the Windows Azure Cmdlets in order to install the certificate and obtain the account information.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Open an Internet Explorer browser and go to <a href="https://manage.windowsazure.com/download/publishprofile.aspx">https://manage.windowsazure.com/download/publishprofile.aspx</a>.</p></li>

<h3 id="Exercise_3_Using_Visual_Studio_to_Publish_Applications">Exercise 3: Using Visual Studio to Publish Applications</h3>

<p>Previously, you learnt how to deploy applications to Windows Azure using the Management Portal and a set of PowerShell cmdlets. If you are a developer, you may find it more convenient during your development cycle to deploy your applications directly from Visual Studio. </p>

<p>The first time you publish a service to Windows Azure using Visual Studio, you need to create the necessary credentials to access your account. For doing this, you will use the PublishSettings file you downloaded in the previous exercise. </p>

<p>Once you set up your account information in Visual Studio, you can publish your current solution in the background with only a few mouse clicks.</p>

<p>In this exercise, you set up the credentials to authenticate with the Windows Azure Management Service and then publish the MyTodo application from Visual Studio.</p>

<p><a name="Ex3Task1"></a></p>

<h4 id="Task_1_-_Preparing_the_Solution_for_Publish">Task 1 - Preparing the Solution for Publish</h4>

<p>When you publish your service using Visual Studio, the Windows Azure Tools upload the service package and then automatically start it. You will not have a chance to update the configuration settings before the service starts. Therefore, you must configure all the necessary settings before you publish the service.</p>

<p>In this task, you update the storage connection strings to point to your Storage Account.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Open Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 as administrator. To do this, in <strong>Start | All Programs | Microsoft Visual Studio 2010</strong>, right-click the <strong>Microsoft Visual Studio 2010</strong> shortcut and choose <strong>Run as Administrator</strong>. </p></li>
<li><p>In the <strong>File</strong> menu, choose <strong>Open</strong> and then <strong>Project/Solution</strong>. In the <strong>Open Project</strong> dialog, browse to <strong>Ex3-DeployingWithVisualStudio\Begin</strong> in the <strong>Source</strong> folder of the lab, select <strong>MyTodo.sln</strong> and click <strong>Open</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is the same solution deployed earlier except for a legend in its footer area to indicate that it was deployed using <strong>Visual Studio</strong>.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>In <strong>Solution Explorer</strong>, expand the <strong>Roles</strong> node inside the <strong>MyTodo</strong> cloud project and then double-click the <strong>MyTodo.WebUx</strong> role.</p></li>
<li><p>In the <strong>MyTodo.WebUx [Role]</strong> window, switch to the <strong>Settings</strong> tab and configure the necessary Storage account details replacing [YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME] with the name of your storage account and [YOUR_ACCOUNT_KEY] with the shared key. Do this for both <em>DataConnectionString</em> and <em>Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Plugins.Diagnostics.ConnectionString</em> settings. These are the same values that you used in previous exercises to configure the application.</p></li>
<li><p>Press <strong>CTRL + S</strong> to save your changes. </p></li>

<h4 id="Task_2_-_Publishing_a_Service_with_the_Windows_Azure_Tools">Task 2 - Publishing a Service with the Windows Azure Tools</h4>

<p>In this task, you will configure a set of credentials that provide access to your Windows Azure account. Visual Studio saves this information and allows you to reuse the credentials whenever you need to publish a service, without requiring you to enter your credentials again.</p>

<p>Then, you will use these credentials to publish the MyTODO application directly from Visual Studio.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In <strong>Solution Explorer</strong>, right-click the <strong>MyTodo</strong> cloud project and select <strong>Publish</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>In the <strong>Publish Windows Azure Application</strong> dialog, click <strong>Import</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Browse to the PublishSettings file you dowloaded in the previous exercise, select it and click <strong>Open</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Back in the <strong>Publish Windows Azure Application</strong> dialog, select the subscription created from the <em>PublishSettings</em> file and click <strong>Next</strong>.</p>

<li><p>In the <strong>Common Settings</strong> tab, notice that the dialog populates the drop down list labeled <strong>Cloud Service</strong> with the information for all the services configured in your Windows Azure account. Select the cloud service in this list where you wish to deploy the application.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure the <strong>Environment</strong> is set to <em>Production</em> and the <strong>Build Configuration</strong> to <em>Release</em>. Also, set the <strong>Service Configuration</strong> with <em>default</em> value.</p>

<p><img src="images/deployment-common-settings.png?raw=true" alt="Deployment Common Settings" title="Deployment Common Settings" />
</p>

<p><em>Deployment Common Settings</em></p></li>
<li><p>Click <strong>Advanced Settings</strong> tab. Update the <strong>Deployment Label</strong> to <em>MyTodo</em> and check the check box labeled <strong>Append date and time</strong> to identify the deployment in the Developer Portal UI.</p></li>

<h3 id="Exercise_4_Securing_Windows_Azure_with_SSL">Exercise 4: Securing Windows Azure with SSL</h3>

<p>In this exercise, you enable SSL to secure the myTODO application. This involves creating a self-signed certificate for server authentication and uploading it to the Windows Azure portal. With the certificate in place, you add a new HTTPS endpoint to the service model and assign the certificate to this endpoint.  You complete the exercise by deploying the application to Windows Azure one more time and then access it using its HTTPS endpoint.</p>

<p><a name="Ex4Task1"></a></p>

<h4 id="Task_1_-_Adding_an_HTTPS_Endpoint_to_the_Application">Task 1 - Adding an HTTPS Endpoint to the Application</h4>

<p>In this task, you update the service model of MyTODO to add an HTTPS endpoint and then you test the application in the compute emulator.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If not already open, launch Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 in elevated administrator mode. To do this, in <strong>Start | All Programs | Microsoft Visual Studio 2010</strong>, right-click the <strong>Microsoft Visual Studio 2010</strong> shortcut and choose <strong>Run as administrator</strong>. </p></li>
<li><p>In the <strong>File</strong> menu, choose <strong>Open</strong> and then <strong>Project/Solution</strong>. In the <strong>Open Project</strong> dialog, browse to <strong>Ex4-SecuringAppWithSSL\Begin</strong> in the <strong>Source</strong> folder of the lab, select <strong>MyTodo.sln</strong> and click <strong>Open</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Expand the <strong>Roles</strong> node in the <strong>MyTodo</strong> project, and then double-click the <strong>MyTodo.WebUx</strong> role to open its properties window.</p></li>
<li><p>In the <strong>MyTodo.WebUx [Role]</strong> window, switch to the <strong>Settings</strong> tab and configure the necessary Storage account details replacing [YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME] with the name of your storage account and [YOUR_ACCOUNT_KEY] with the shared key. Do this for both <em>DataConnectionString</em> and <em>Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Plugins.Diagnostics.ConnectionString</em> settings. These  are the same values that you used in previous exercises to configure the application. Remember to set the Type to Connection String for the both settings after leaving this screen.</p></li>
<li><p>Next, switch to the <strong>Endpoints</strong> tab and select the <strong>HTTPS</strong> option, fill Public Port with the value 443 and leave the <strong>Name</strong> field unchanged. Do not choose an SSL certificate at this time; you will do so later in the exercise.</p>

<p><img src="images/adding-http-endpoint.png?raw=true" alt="Adding an HTTP endpoint to the application" title="Adding an HTTP endpoint to the application" />
</p>

<p><em>Adding an HTTP endpoint to the application</em></p></li>
<li><p>Now, choose the HTTPS endpoint as the one to use when you launch the application in the browser when you are debugging it. To do this, right-click the <strong>MyTodo.WebUx</strong> role in the <strong>MyTodo</strong> project, point to <strong>Launch in Browser</strong>, and then ensure that only <strong>HTTPS</strong> is selected.</p>

<p><img src="images/choosing-debug-endpoint.png?raw=true" alt="Choosing the endpoint used to debug the application" title="Choosing the endpoint used to debug the application" />
</p>

<p><em>Choosing the endpoint used to debug the application</em></p></li>
<li><p>You will now test the application locally. Press <strong>F5</strong> to build and launch the application in the compute emulator. Notice that the browser indicates that there is a problem with the certificate. Ignore the warning and click <strong>Continue to this website</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="images/certificate-error-computer-emulator.png?raw=true" alt="Certificate error when testing in the compute emulator" title="Certificate error when testing in the compute emulator" />
</p>

<p><em>Certificate error when testing in the compute emulator</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When testing your application in the local development environment using SSL, you do not need to configure a certificate. Instead, the compute emulator handles this requirement by using its own certificate. However, the certification authority for the certificate that it uses is not trusted, hence the warning. You may safely ignore the warning while you test your application locally.</p>

<p>If you wish, you can remove the warning by installing the certificate in the <strong>Trusted Root Certification Authorities</strong> certificate store. Note, however, that this has security implications that you need to evaluate before you proceed.</p>

<p>To remove the warning, open the <strong>Microsoft Management Console</strong>, add an instance of the <strong>Certificates</strong> snap-in and configure it to manage certificates for the <strong>Computer</strong> account. Expand the <strong>Personal\Certificates</strong> store and locate a certificate issued to 127.0.0.1. To ensure that you have the right certificate, view its properties to verify that the <strong>Subject</strong> and <strong>Issuer</strong> fields identify the certificate as belonging to the compute emulator. To trust the certificate, simply drag and drop the certificate from the <strong>Personal</strong> certificate store into the <strong>Trusted Root Certification Authorities</strong> certificate store.</p>

<h4 id="Task_2_-_Creating_a_Self-Signed_Certificate">Task 2 - Creating a Self-Signed Certificate</h4>

<p>In this task, you create a self-signed certificate that you can upload to the Windows Azure Developer Portal to configure an SSL endpoint for your application.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> if you are unable to use Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager in your environment, you may skip this task. Instead, you can find a self-signed certificate that you can use among the lab's resources.</p>

<p>To install the certificate, open Windows Explorer, browse to <strong>Assets</strong> in the <strong>Source</strong> folder of the lab and then double-click the <strong>YourNameToDo.pfx</strong> file to install the certificate using the <strong>Certificate Import Wizard</strong>. Use &quot;password1&quot; (without the quotation marks) as the password. Use default values for all other options.</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> You should only use this certificate to complete the steps in the exercise. Do not use the certificate in your production deployments.</p>

<p>In this task, you deploy the application to Windows Azure and access its HTTPS endpoint to verify that your enabled SSL successfully.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Publish and deploy the application once again to the Windows Azure environment using your preferred method, by choosing among the Windows Azure Developer Portal, the Windows Azure Service Management PowerShell Cmdlets, or the Windows Azure Tools for Visual Studio. Refer to Exercises 1, 2, and 3 for instructions on how to carry out the deployment with any of these methods.</p>

<h4 id="Task_5_-_Configuring_a_CNAME_Entry_for_DNS_Resolution_Optional">Task 5 - Configuring a CNAME Entry for DNS Resolution (Optional)</h4>

<p>When you deploy your application, the Windows Azure fabric assigns it a URL of the form <em>http://[yournametodo].azurewebsites.net</em>, where [<em>yournametodo</em>] is the public name that you chose for your cloud service at the time of creation. While this URL is completely functional, there are many reasons why you might prefer to use a URL in your own domain to access the service. In other words, instead of accessing the application as <em><a href="http://yournametodo.azurewebsites.net">http://yournametodo.azurewebsites.net</a></em>, use your own organization's domain name instead, for example <em><a href="http://yournametodo.fabrikam.com">http://yournametodo.fabrikam.com</a></em>.</p>

<p>One way to map the application to your own domain is to set up a CNAME record in your own DNS system pointing at the host name in Azure. A CNAME provides an alias for any host record, including hosts in different domains. Thus, to map the application to the <em>fabrikam.com</em> domain, you can create the following record in your DNS.</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<td><strong>Organization's domain</strong></td>
<td><strong>Alias</strong></td>
<td><strong>Application's domain</strong></td>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td>yournametodo.fabrikam.com</td>
<td>CNAME</td>
<td>yournametodo.azurewebsites.net</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>The procedure for doing this varies depending on the details of your DNS infrastructure. For external domain registrars, you can consult their documentation to find out the correct procedure for setting up a CNAME. For additional information on this topic, see <a href="http://blog.smarx.com/posts/custom-domain-names-in-windows-azure">Custom Domain Names in Windows Azure</a>.
As an example, this task briefly shows how you set up an alias using Microsoft DNS on Windows Server 2008. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Windows DNS Server should be installed on the Windows Server 2008. You can enable the DNS Server role on the Server Manager.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><p>Open DNS Manager from <strong>Start | Administrative Tools | DNS</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>In DNS Manager, expand the <strong>Forward Lookup Zones</strong> node, then right-click the zone where you intend to set up the alias and select <strong>New Alias (CNAME)</strong>.Notice that if you do not have any zone, you must create one prior the alias creation.</p>

<p><img src="images/creating-alias.png?raw=true" alt="Updating a lookup zone to create an alias" title="Updating a lookup zone to create an alias" />
</p>

<p><em>Updating a lookup zone to create an alias</em></p></li>
<li><p>In the <strong>New Resource Record</strong> dialog, enter the alias name that you would like to use to access the application hosted in Azure, for example, <em>yournametodo</em>. Then, type in the fully qualified domain name of your application that Azure assigned to your application, for example, <em>[yournametodo].azurewebsites.net</em>. Click <strong>OK</strong> to create the record.</p>
